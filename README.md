PlusOnion is a collection of filter lists that accompany existing filter lists to add more coverage for [Tor Onion Services](https://support.torproject.org/onionservices/onionservices-2/). ([Learn more about Tor.](https://www.torproject.org/about/history/))

Every PlusOnion filter lists has been tested with [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org) (with [Acceptable Ads](https://acceptableads.org/) turned off), and [Brave Shields](https://brave.com/shields/). If you see something that doesn't work, let me know!

*PlusOnion is not affiliated with any filter list in this repository and is not affiliated with The Tor Project, Inc. PlusOnion is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.*

### Note on anonymity
Using any add-on with the Tor Browser [is a surefire way to deanonymize you](https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-14/). Make that plus a few with something like an adblocker - and then even more so if you're using PlusOnion.

Tails users [can already potentially be fingerprinted as Tails users since it has uBlock Origin pre-installed](https://tails.net/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html#fingerprint) in addition to the existing Tor Browser add-ons. PlusOnion *will* make fingerprinting you easier - especially on Onion Services - as websites can detect that something's being blocked. PlusOnion or anything similar does not come with Tails.

*If you care about and/or depend on your absolute anonymity, DO NOT use PlusOnion with the Tor Browser.*

### Filter lists
Note that PlusOnion filter lists work *alongside* existing filter lists, not in place of them.
