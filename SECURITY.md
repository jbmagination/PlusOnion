If you believe you've found a security vulnerability with a script in the `scripts` folder, [submit a security advisory via GitHub](https://github.com/jbmagination/plusonion/security/advisories/new).

Anything else is likely not applicable to PlusOnion. You should consider contacting these parties instead:
* [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=security_report.yml)
* [Adblock Plus](https://help.adblockplus.org/hc/en-us/articles/4402383512211-Need-to-contact-support-Look-here-first-)
* [Brave](https://hackerone.com/brave)
* [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/contact/)

If you still think there's a problem, [submit a security advisory](https://github.com/jbmagination/plusonion/security/advisories/new) anyway! The worst I can do is say no or redirect you elsewhere. I promise to be friendly.
